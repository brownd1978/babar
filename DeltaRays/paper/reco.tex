\subsection{\eetomm Event Selection}
\subsection{\deltaray Candidate Identification}
	\deltaray candidates are selected from 2 \mumu events. For the beam pipe we require that at least 1 of the \mmu passes through the beam pipe. From that event electrons are selected that have reconstructed vertices within the beam pipe region. The tracks are required to have less than 0.2 radian angle between the tracks at the vertex, and a distance of closest approach of 0.1cm. The electron track is then required to have 3 SVT hits.
