1) Structure, Design and Actual Radial Dimensions
   ==============================================

    The beampipe in essence consists of 2 Be cylinders with a layer
  of cooling water in between. The actual structure is somewhat more
  complicated.

    To the engineers, the inner cylinder is the beampipe and the outer
  cylinder is the water jacket.

    The beampipe has a constant inner diameter, and an initial design
  wall thickness of 0.086". The outer surface was machined according to
  a phi-z pattern which will be described later in order to create a
  channel allowing the flow of cooling water; the design depth of this
  channel is 0.054", so that over most of the tracking volume the
  design thickness of the beampipe is 0.032".

   The water jacket also has a constant inner diameter. The design
  length is 11.49", and for the last 2.20" at each end the wall
  thickness doubles from 0.020" to 0.040".

   After the machining of the beampipe and water jacket had been
  completed, the outside surface of the beampipe, and the inside
  surface of the water jacket, were nickel-plated to protect against
  corrosion due to the cooling water. The spec. for the Ni layer was
  7+/-1 microns; measurements of the inside diameter of the water
  jacket before and after plating indicate that an average value of
  ~ 9 microns was actually achieved.

   After assembly, the outer surface of the water jacket was sprayed
  with BR127 Corrosion Inhibiting Primer [as used on every plane you
  fly in]. Two coats were applied, yielding a layer estimated to be
  15 +/- 5 microns thick. This is to prevent oxidation of the Be.

   This primer was also flowed through the water channel, resulting
  in a coating which is estimated to be 10 microns thick; the 
  difference is due to the different mode of application.

   According to the supplier [CYTEC], the primer has a SG = 1.37 when
  dry, and contains ~15% by weight of Strontium Chromate [Sr Cr O_4 ;
  SG = 3.895]. This constitutes ~5.3% by volume, the remainder being
  a 50/50 mixture of epoxy and phenolic resins [effective average SG =
  1.23, which is about the same as Lexan]. An estimate of the R.L. and
  dE/dx properties of this stuff is made in section 3.

  Gold was sputtered onto the inside surface of the beampipe; 
  measurements of a test copper foil which had been subjected to this
  process yielded a layer thickness ranging from 3 - 6 microns, with
  an average value of 4.3 microns.


  The following compares the design and actual radial dimensions of
  the beampipe and water jacket [ actual values provided by Karen Fant].
  Measurements were taken prior to Ni plating.
  All dimensions are in inches; diameter is specified, NOT radius.

(*) 2 copies of the beampipe and waterjacket were built [approx.cost
    $150,000]; the range of measurements and average value are taken
    over both copies since there is no record of which beampipe was
    combined with which water jacket to form the final assembly.
    The copy is crated and kept as a spare somewhere in the Vacuum
    Building. The contact person at SLAC is Leo Giannini,
    ext.3143, Building 202. Karen Fant should also be consulted, since
    she was the Beampipe Project Engineer.

    The copy has no inside layer of sputtered gold.

3) Estimated Properties of BR127; other R.L. and dE/dx info.
   =========================================================

 BR127 composition:  15% by weight Sr Cr O_4 , remainder a 50/50
                     mix of phenolic and epoxy resins

                     S.G. when dry  = 1.37 [ from CYTEC ]

                     S.G. Sr Cr O_4 = 3.895


 Resin: approximate as an average of Nylon and Lexan
 -----

        R.L.   =   41.65 gm/cm**2

        dE/dx  =    1.93 MeV/[gm/cm**2]


 Sr Cr O_4:
 ----------

            R.L.[gm/cm**2]      dE/dx[MeV/{gm/cm**2}]
 ------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sr         11.03               1.33 {using Ge and Sn}

 Cr         15.25               1.46 {using Ti and Fe}

 O          34.24               1.80


 Then, using the relevant atomic weights,

   1/X0 =  [ 87.62/11.03 + 52.0/15.25 + 64.0/34.24] / 203.62

              =  0.06494

 so that   X0[Sr Cr O_4] = 15.4 gm/cm**2

                         = 15.4 / 3.895  cm  = 3.95 cm

 Similarly,

  dE/dx =  [ 87.62*1.33 + 52.0*1.46 + 64.0*1.80] / 203.62

        =  1.51 MeV/[gm/cm**2]   =  1.51*3.895 MeV/cm

                                 =  5.88 MeV/cm


 BR127:
 -----
       Combining these results to obtain estimates for BR127:

      1/X0  = 0.15/15.4  + 0.85/41.65  = 0.030

      X0    =  33.3 gm/cm**2

            =  33.3/1.37 cm  =  24.2 cm


      dE/dx =  0.15*1.51 + 0.85*1.93 = 1.87 MeV/{gm/cm**2}

            =  1.87 * 1.37  MeV/cm   = 2.56 MeV/cm

  ********
   i) the net R.L. is almost the same for the regions with and without
      Be removed by machining; energy loss is 10-20% higher for the
      regions from which Be has NOT been removed.

   ii) each side of the water channel has a 9 micron layer of Ni and
      a 10 micron layer of BR127 extending approx. 0.134 cm in the
      radial direction; this will increase the amount of material
      seen in the vicinity of the "ribs" on the outside of the beampipe
      which define the water flow.

   and track generation [MC].

   The region of z [w.r.t. the IP] considered is therefore as follows:

   i) z>0 :   up to z = 13.477 cm, nominal; this corresponds to ~60%
              of the length of the thicker portion of the water
              jacket [i.e.is well under the Tantalum foil], and by
              terminating here, the water channel geometry that
              need be modeled is made simpler.


              For the innermost beampipe radius [ 2.4976 cm ], the
              corresponding polar angle w.r.t. z = 0 is 10.50 deg;
              the interaction region is usually confined almost
              entirely to |z| < 4.0 cm; the polar angle is still
              only 14.76 deg. w.r.t. z = +4.0 cm, so that this range
              of z terminates well below the forward track
              reconstruction horizon [ ~ 20 deg. ] in all cases.


  ii) z<0 :   up to the beginning of the aluminum collar which
              overlaps the thicker portion of the outer Be
              cylinder; this corresponds to z = -12.446 cm, nominal.

              For the innermost beampipe radius [ 2.4976 cm ], the
              corresponding polar angle w.r.t. z = 0 is 11.35 deg
              relative to the negative z axis; this polar angle is
              still only 16.47 deg. w.r.t. z = -4.0 cm, so that this
              range of z terminates well below the backward track
              reconstruction horizon [ ~ 30 deg. ] in all cases.

Note: The outer edge of the Tantalum foil corresponds to a radius of
****  2.851 cm. The foil begins at z = + 10.137 cm and -7.871 cm, and
      these values correspond to forward and backward polar angles of
      15.71 and 19.91 deg, resp., which are well below the relevant
      tracking horizon. However, the z values which correspond to these
      horizon angles w.r.t. the edges of the Tantalum are +2.31 cm
      and -2.93 cm [ignoring slope and offset of the beam collision
      axis], so that tracks near the tracking horizon angles will
      "see" the tantalum foil if they originate from the outer
      |z| reaches of the luminous region.

  Specification of the Water Channel Geometry
  ********************************************

  The water channel geometry can be seen in top and side views at:


http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~wmd/beampipe/waterchannel.ps.gz

  where I have shaded in red the areas of Be which are NOT machined
  away to form the water channel. Top and bottom, the unmachined Be
  is just a strip of constant width for the range of z of interest.
  This is true of the side regions for z<0, but in the positive z
  region the azimuthal range of the unmachined region varies with z.


  A cross-sectional view corresponding to z<0 and in the region of
  the thicker water jacket wall, can be found at:


http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~wmd/beampipe/crosssection.ps.gz

  here I have shaded in red the water flow regions so as to outline
  the "ribs" on the beampipe. There is actually a small gap between
  each rib and the water jacket [the beampipe had to be inserted into
  the water jacket without scratching the Ni plating], and water
  should flow in this region also; I estimate the gap size to be
  ~140 microns, and this is included in material descriptions 4b and 4d
  of the previous section.

  A y-z section of the entire assembly can be found at:


http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~wmd/beampipe/yzsection.ps.gz

  with relevant z dimensions indicated. Radial dimensions should be
  obtained from sections 2 and 4 above.

  In order to describe the water channel geometry, I divide the z
  region of interest into 5 sub-regions. All z coords. are in cm.
  w.r.t. the IP, and azimuth is specified in radians in the usual
  B-Factory coord.system.

  I.  (- 12.446) < z < (- 7.871 )
      ---------------------------

     Define  deltaphi1  =  0.0  +/- 0.140  and     pi  +/- 0.140
             deltaphi2  =  pi/2 +/- 0.140  and 3*pi/2  +/- 0.140

     Then    deltaphi1              corres. to   material  4d

             deltaphi2              corres. to   material  4d

     2*pi - (deltaphi1 + deltaphi2) corres. to   material  4c


 II.  (-  7.971) < z < (  2.711 )
      ---------------------------

             deltaphi1              corres. to   material  4b

             deltaphi2              corres. to   material  4b

     2*pi - (deltaphi1 + deltaphi2) corres. to   material  4a


 III. (   2.711) < z < ( 10.137 )
      ---------------------------

     Let     dphi1      =  0.140 + (z - 2.711) * 0.0552

     Define  deltaphi3  =  0.0  +/- dphi1  and     pi  +/- dphi1


     Then    deltaphi2              corres. to   material  4b

             deltaphi3              corres. to   material  4b

     2*pi - (deltaphi2 + deltaphi3) corres. to   material  4a


 IV.  (  10.137) < z < ( 11.700 )
      ---------------------------

     Let     dphi2      =  0.550 - (z -10.137) * 0.262

     Define  deltaphi4  =  0.0  +/- dphi2  and     pi  +/- dphi2


     Then    deltaphi2              corres. to   material  4d

             deltaphi4              corres. to   material  4d

     2*pi - (deltaphi2 + deltaphi4) corres. to   material  4c


  V.  (  11.700) < z < ( 13.477 )
      ---------------------------

             deltaphi2              corres. to   material  4d

     2*pi - (deltaphi2)             corres. to   material  4c


     The linear approx. to the channel wall in region IV is
   reasonable, and since this region is entirely under the Tantalum
   foil, this description should be adequate to our needs.


6) A Proposal for an Effective Beampipe Representation
   ===================================================

  i) Treat the beampipe as a simple cylinder over the z range

        - 12.446 .le. z .le. 13.477 cm

     with

        internal radius = 2.4972 cm  [ = internal beampipe radius
                                         - Au skin depth          ]

        external radius = 2.7868 cm  [ = external water jacket radius
                                         + BR127 coating thickness   ]

  ii) Divide the beampipe into four z intervals as follows:

       A) - 12.446  <  z  <  - 7.871 cm

       B) -  7.871  <  z  <    2.711 cm

       C)    2.711  <  z  <   10.137 cm

       D)   10.137  <  z  <   13.477 cm

      and for each interval treat the cylinder as made of a composite
      material having the relevant percentage composition by weight
      and average density. These latter quantities should be obtained
      by performing the appropriate volume integral over r, phi and
      z for each individual material, and then combining the results
      as indicated in the following subsection.

  iii) The effective volume per unit length in z is

           Veff  = pi * [ r(external)**2 - r(internal)**2 ] * delta z

                 = 4.8074  cm**3

       We now must obtain the mass contributions for each material in
       each of regions A,B,C and D.

10) The Support Tube
   ================

   The support tube consists of a central section made of carbon fibre,
   and forward and backward sections made of stainless steel.

   The C fibre tube was manufactured by AMALGA Composites, Inc. of
   West Allis, Wisconsin; the contact person there is Gregg Piper
   [Tel: (414) 453-9555].
    According to him, the final material density is:

       0.058 lbs/cu.in. =  1.605 gm/ cm**3

   The composition by weight is   52% C , 48% epoxy resin.

   If I take the S.G. of C = 2.265, the net density and weight
   composition imply a density of 1.219 gm/ cm**3 for the epoxy resin.
   This seems like a reasonable number. It is very close to that for
   Lexan ( 1.20 ) and not very different from that for Nylon ( 1.14 ).

   A reasonable material model would be to treat the tube as being
   composed according to one of the following prescriptions:

   i) C and Lexan: by volume, 38.0% C, 62.0% Lexan
                   by weight, 53.7% C, 46.3% Lexan


  ii) C and Nylon: by volume, 41.3% C, 58.7% Nylon
                   by weight, 58.3% C, 41.7% Nylon

  Each of these gives a net density of 1.605 gm/ cm**3, but i) gives
  a closer match to the actual material composition.

  The cylinder was built on a mandrel whose diameter was the nominal
  inner diameter [17.075 inches]; 4 layers of C fibre soaked in resin
  were laid down at stereo angles [85,+/-10,+/-10,85] degrees; this
  created the nominal thickness. A further 0.065" C fibre layer was
  added, and finally a 0.030" fibre glass skin completed the winding
  process. The fibre glass is subjected to longitudinal tension in
  order to compress the soggy mess underneath; this is called
  "debulking"; you can't do this with C fibre, since it breaks.

  After curing, the fibre glass is machined away, and the extra C fibre
  layer ground down in order to reach the specified wall thickness.
  The dimensions of the finished product were checked using a coordinate
  measuring machine in order to verify that they were within
  specification.

  Gregg Piper could not find the CMM data. The only measurements I
  was able to obtain were from Martin Nordby at SLAC, and pertained
  to the cylinder thickness at each end. Average values were 0.079"
  at one end and 0.085" at the other. The spec. on thickness was
  +/- 0.005", and on inner radius was +/- 0.010". Since the cylinder
  was built on a mandrel, it is probably reasonable to use the nominal
  value for the inner radius in the absence of info. to the contrary.
  Since the cylinder was machined down from a larger thickness, it is
  reasonable to expect that it might tend to be slightly thicker than
  nominal. The average of the SLAC measurements is 0.082", in
  agreement with this "logic", so it is probably reasonable to use
  this value.

  For a thickness of 0.082"=0.2083cm, and model (i):

   % by weight C     = 53.7           R.L.= 42.70 g/cm**2 = 18.8 cm
                                     dE/dx= 1.745 MeV/(g/cm**2)

   % by weight Lexan = 46.3           R.L.= 41.46 g/cm**2 = 34.6 cm
                                     dE/dx= 1.886 MeV/(g/cm**2)

  we obtain     R.L. = 42.12 g/cm**2 = 26.24 cm for S.G.=1.605

               dE/dx = 1.810 MeV/(g/cm**2) = 2.909 MeV/cm for S.G.=1.605

  It follows that a thickness of 0.2083 cm corresponds to:

   0.794 % R.L.   and  a  min.I energy loss of 0.605 MeV

  at normal incidence, in this model.


   Dimensions of interest are then as follows:

Scott,
I looked over my old files on the CFC Central Tube for the Support 
Tube, and found a few things.

Dwg #:  SC-343-910-02

Dimensions per the drawing:

 Inside diameter        :  17.075 +/- 0.020"
 Wall thickness         :   0.080 +/- 0.005"
 Outside diameter       :  17.235" reference dimension

Dimensions per Amalga Composite fab process description

 Mandrel diameter       :  17.045"
 Ground outside diameter:  17.235" max

Amalga wrapped the wet CFC filament-wound tube with fiberglass 
pre-preg to maintain compactness of the fiber wrapping during cure.  
After they cured, most/all of this was ground off.  You could see some
local regions where there was just a flash of this left on the tube 
after grinding, but pretty much all of it was removed during the 
post-cure grinding.

My recollection was that the mandrel was aluminum.  The tube cured at 
275 degF, per their process plan, so this would explain why the 
diameter is undersized.

CMM inspection data showed that we checked 2 thicknesses at each end. 
One end was 0.079" thick at both locations checked.  The other end was 
0.084" and 0.085" thick.  This is within tolerance. I remember thinking
about doing thickness testing throughout the tube, but couldn't work
out a reliable way to do that.
I can't find any record of as-measured OD, so it's hard to set a max 
possible dimension.  I can't believe that I didn't measure OD, so I'll
keep looking.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment added by WMD
--------------------
   Al has a coefft. of expansion     2.31 * 10^{-5} / deg. K

C Fib has a coefft. of expansion ~0.7-1.0 * 10^{-5} / deg. K
[PAN Precursor Fiber]
as far as I can find out

For a 200 deg. F increase in temp., the Al should expand by ~ 0.044"

For a 200 deg. F decrease in temp., the CF should contract by ~0.013"
                                                              -0.019"

so that the net internal diameter should be ~ 17.070 - 17.076 "
This agrees with Martin's measurements.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Taking the worst-case dimensions measured and theoretical, the 
worst-case thickness could be 17.235" OD - 17.045" Mandrel 
diameter = 0.095" thick.  This could be a rational upper bound on 
thickness for BaBar folks to use in mass cross-section analyses.

On a related topic, the load test curves for the fully-assembled 
Support Tube showed that we were getting about 25% more deflection
than the ANSYS model predicted.  I didn't have time to track down the
reason, but it always bugged me.  One possible explanation is that the
CFC tube wasn't as stiff as predicted because there wasn't the correct
mass fraction of carbon fiber, and too much epoxy.  We never weighed
the tube, so this theory can't be confirmed, but if the epoxy is denser
than carbon fibers, this theory would support BaBar's suspiscions.

Per Amalga documents, materials were:

 Epoxy        :  Epon 826 resin
 Carbon fibers:  Courtaulds G34-700 12k fiber

I hope this helps. I'll try to unearth any additional inspection data 
and let you know if I find some.

Dear Dennis,
            Thank you. That is the nominal thickness. The spec. was
to be within 5 mils of this. Martin Nordby measured 79 mils at one
end and 85 mils at the other, so it might be a few % thicker than
nominal. Maybe some day we can check it more carefully.

    Best regards,

13) Inner SVT R.F.Shield and Inner Be Wall of the Dch
    =================================================

    The SVT has an inner R.F. shield at a radius of ~3.2 cm. In
thickness it consists of 100 microns of carbon fibre with a 25 micron
Al skin on the larger radius side.

  The inner wall of the Drift Chamber in the tracking region is made
of Be of thickness 1 mm. In length its range is -546.17 < z < 803.17 mm
in the B-Factory coord. system; there is an additional region of length
4.83 mm at each end corresponding to the joint with the remainder of
the inner wall, which consists of Al of 5 mm thickness; in the overlap
regions, the Al thickness is 2 mm, and is at larger radius than the Be.

 The Be cylinder is made of 3 sheets of material brazed together by
means of Be ribs located at 90, 210 and 330 deg. in azimuth; the
x-y cross-section of an individual rib is shown at

 Dch Inner Cylinder Be rib

The inner radius of the Be cylinder is 238 mm, and for the Al cylinder
it is 236 mm outside the regions of overlap.

Both Be surfaces are painted with the same BR127 anti-corrosion paint
used on the beampipe. According to Richard Boyce, the specified
thickness was 0.003" [= 76.2 microns] on each surface, which then
gives a total thickness of 0.01524 cm.
[From above, BR127 is estimated to have X0=24.2 cm and 
dE/dx = 2.56 Mev/cm]

The surface of the cylinder in contact with the gas volume was NOT
subsequently covered with Aluminum foil. This can be seen in the
following picture taken during stringing:

 Dch Inner Cylinder during Stringing

The greenish colour [due to BR127] of the Be section is in contrast to
the Aluminum section at the end which is visible in the picture.

Note: The inner wall was constructed from 3 Be panels. Measurements of
----  panel thickness prior to construction [see Richard Boyce for data]
      yielded values ~0.044" on average i.e. ~10% beyond spec. It is
      assumed that, as a consequence of cleaning after assembly, this
      was reduced to ~ 1 mm [especially since the process had to be
      carried out twice; the original cylinder was damaged and had to
      be shortened, thus necessitating a second cleaning]

      The panels are brazed to Be ribs running parallel to the cylinder
      axis. These are 1 mm wide in the r-phi direction, and 3 mm thick
      in the radial direction. One rib is at phi=90 deg., and the others
      are at +/- 120 deg. w.r.t. this position.


   The contributions due to these additional materials, Be ribs not
   included, are as follows:

A Composite Material Representing the Dch Inner Wall for Track
--------------------------------------------------------------
Reconstruction
--------------

1) Treat as Be( 1 mm.) and BR127 Paint( 0.1524 mm)

2) In MC, rmin = 23.78276 cm, rmax = 23.9000 cm

3) Weight fractions:  BR127 = 0.1015, Be = 0.8985

   Effective Density: 1.785 gm / cm**3


4) Effective R.L.  = 61.890 gm / cm**2       = 34.68 cm.

5) Effective dE/dx =  1.622 MeV / {gm/cm**2} =  2.89 MeV / cm.


6) If you want to keep the inner radius at the nominal 23.8000 cm, the
   effective density increases by 1.152, to give

   Effective density =  2.056 gm / cm**3

   Effective R.L.    = 61.89 gm / cm**2        = 30.10 cm.

   Effective dE/dx   =  1.622 MeV / {gm/cm**2} =  3.33 MeV / cm.

   Note that for Be alone:

             density =  1.848 gm / cm**3

             R.L.    = 35.24  cm.

             dE/dx   =  2.946 MeV / cm.

   so that the effect of the paint is not negligible.

Additional SVT Material in Layers 4 and 5

Here is some correspondence with Giovanni Calderini w.r.t. this material
and with Dave Brown regarding its inclusion in Detector Model.

Dear Dave,
          I tried to estimate the material as follows:

Material:  Kevlar
--------
Nominal Thickness:  ?  [Looks to be same as for ribs]
-----------------

Layer 4
-------
       center at z ~ + 6.4 cm on outside surface of wafer

       sides[2]:  z length 40 mm, length normal to wafer 10 mm,
                  effective thickness allowing for holes = 0.84*nominal

       base    :  z length 40 mm, width in wafer surface 27.3 mm,
                  effective thickness allowing for holes = 0.92*nominal

Layer 5
-------
       center at z ~ + 6.2 cm on outside surface of wafer

       sides[2]:  z length 40 mm, length normal to wafer 10 mm,
                  effective thickness allowing for holes = 0.84*nominal

       base    :  z length 40 mm, width in wafer surface 32.3 mm,
                  effective thickness allowing for holes = 0.93*nominal

I hope this is of help.

           Best regards,
                        Bill

Dear Dave,
          I asked Giovanni Calderini about the material in layers 4 and
5, and attach his response. I guess that it is Kevlar, and from the
drawing it seems to be of the same thickness as the ribs, but I don't
see a thickness specified. The 4 holes in each side can be seen in the
picture of Giovanni and Ben Smith, so that looks o.k. However, in the
picture the base has only 8 triangular holes instead of 16, so there is
a bit more material than the drawing would indicate. I guess this could
just be included as solid Kevlar with the thickness reduced to take
account of the holes.
                     Best regards,
                                  Bill

Dear Bill, how are you?

I had noticed your beautifiul tomographies, I already had a chance to
congratulate with Jon some time ago. I think the r-phi cross section
could really go in the official BaBar plots, maybe aside of the
SVT r-phi section drawing.

The centerpiece you refer to is a kevlar piece which is use to connect
each backward and forward half-module. I've dug in the documentation
and I found a drawing of this piece, which I'm attaching to the email.
The ribs for backward and forward half-modules are independent. This
U piece is used to lock them together. Ideally there is epoxy glue
only between the ribs and the sides of the U, while no glue is
underneath it, when it touches the silicons. This glue is supposed to
melt at high temperature, in case you want to separate the two
half modules to replace either one (I'm sure it would never work,
anyway...)

Bill L. and I are in the process of improving the SVT material
description in the simulation (for instance adding the fanouts,
another issue that you were the first to raise). It's a good time
to add also this piece, if it's missing.

If you find some effect which looks strange in the SVT region,
please feel free to drop an email. I think there is not enough
interaction between the tracking people and the core SVT group
(this is mainly my fault, because I'm half of the time in
Italy and I don't attend tracking meetings very often). But
every time we have interacted, we have understood and improved
a lot of things!

Cheers,
        -Giovanni

14) Outer Wall of the Dch
    =====================

  The outer wall of the Drift Chamber is composed of 2 layers of C
fibre, each of thickness 1.5 mm, with 6 mm of Nomex in between. I have
not been able to obtain R.L. or dE/dx information for Nomex, but the
concensus is that it can be represented reasonably by increasing the C
fibre thickness by 10 %. The innermost surface has a 50 micron Al skin,
and the outermost surface has a 100 micron Al skin to provide R.F
shielding and grounding.

   The inner surface is at a nominal radius of 800 mm, and the length
is 2764 mm, extending from z= - 1015 mm to z= 1749 mm in the B-Factory
coordinate system. The detailed structure changes from that indicated
above in the last ~28 mm at each end, however the material description
continues to apply in these regions, to a good approximation.

   The estimated characteristics of these materials are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Material          Thickness     % R.L.         dE[ MeV, min I, normal
                    [cm]                             incidence ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  C Fibre           0.3000        1.143          0.873

  Nomex             0.6000        0.114          0.087

                                  [estimated as 10% of
                                   C fibre contributions]
